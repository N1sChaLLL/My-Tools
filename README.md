<h1 align="center" id="title">My works</h1>

<p id="description">These are some tools I've designed using python mostly (its's efficient). One of them is a excel tuples generator Imagine you have an excel file with multiple sheets present in it and you gotta skim through multiple files to look at some rows my application asks you for the sheet and the any entity name in the tuple and it fetches all the rows and desired attributes. Second I've had a lot of pain in copying images that have been bookmarked it's takes a lot of time to open the file and fetch the sheet copy from one file to other my exe app takes both the files location and copy's all the bookmarked images from the input file to output file. Third is a Github Social Network analysis, It helps you understand how an user is connected with others with statistics such as reposotories, forks, etc. The Last one is a game recommendation system, it uses live steam games and recommends you the best games as per your wish, if you are a zombie slayer all you gotta do is just add the tag zombie and it suggests you games with live ratings and more info. These are some of my projects :)</p>
