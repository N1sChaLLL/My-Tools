<p id="description">These are some tools I've designed using python mostly (its's efficient). One of them is a excel tuples generator Imagine you have an excel file with multiple sheets present in it and you gotta skim through multiple files to look at some rows my application asks you for the sheet and the any entity name in the tuple and it fetches all the rows and desired attributes. Second I've had a lot of pain in copying images that have been bookmarked it's takes a lot of time to open the file and fetch the sheet copy from one file to other my exe app takes both the files location and copy's all the bookmarked images from the input file to output file.</p>
